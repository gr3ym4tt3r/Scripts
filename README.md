So Far, this is just a collection of scripts i've been making while going thru the PWK Course. There's a few instances 
where you make a script to ping like a specific ip range, or enumerate a specific hostname. So i just ended up making
Vars and functions to turn em into useable scripts. I've mostly been doing this to help myself learn scripting.

Update: 8-24-16
Added the grey.sh script i've been working on. It's a helper script for parsing nmap nse scripts.
Also wrote a little script to rename the pwk vids so they have the topic in the filename instead of just the number.

Another Update 8-24-16
Just fixed a few small bugs in grey.sh and updated the scipvuldb in vulscan to the one that just got posted today
