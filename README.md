So Far, this is just a collection of scripts i've been making while going thru the PWK Course. There's a few instances 
where you make a script to ping like a specific ip range, or enumerate a specific hostname. So i just ended up making
Vars and functions to turn em into useable scripts. I've mostly been doing this to help myself learn scripting.
